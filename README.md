# docker-gnuradio-ubuntu
Automated build for gnuradio projects.

This provides an easy way of running gnuradio's projects.
	
	`Dockerfile` will be the final generic file. My intent is to install any project
	passing an environment variable.

	`gr-gsm.Dockerfile` is an example of a dedicated Dockerfile for the gnuradio's gr-gsm project.
	

# Run:


#TODO:

	Create more Dockerfiles for each individual gr-program.
	Sort of merge them into `Dockerfile`.
	Implement a proper clean in the Dockerfiles.
